 by Kathleen Fitzpatrick	Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy	https://kindle.amazon.com/work/planned-obsolescence-publishing-technology-ebook/B005017RNC/B005TIGKSY	9	My argument in The Anxiety of Obsolescence is, rather, that claims about the obsolescence of cultural forms often say more about those doing the claiming than they do about the object of the claim.

If anything, the scholarly monograph isn’t dead; it is undead.

 by Kathleen Fitzpatrick	Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy	https://kindle.amazon.com/work/planned-obsolescence-publishing-technology-ebook/B005017RNC/B005TIGKSY	8	We must open ourselves up in order to be part of rather than apart from contemporary culture, and in order to do so, we need to expand and rethink the very idea of who our peers are today.
 by Kathleen Fitzpatrick	Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy	https://kindle.amazon.com/work/planned-obsolescence-publishing-technology-ebook/B005017RNC/B005TIGKSY	4	In order for new modes of communication to become broadly accepted within the academy, scholars and their institutions must take a new look at the mission of the university, the goals of scholarly publishing, and the processes through which scholars conduct their work. We must collectively consider what new technologies have to offer us, not just in terms of the cost of publishing or access to publications, but in the ways we research, write, and review.

 by Kathleen Fitzpatrick	Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy	https://kindle.amazon.com/work/planned-obsolescence-publishing-technology-ebook/B005017RNC/B005TIGKSY	5	the system of peer review as we know it today is flawed, a backchannel conversation taking place between editor and reviewer that too often excludes the author from its benefits, and that too often impedes rather than assists in the circulation of ideas.
